# Driver-Fatigue-Detection-using-convolutional-neural-networks.-
•	Implementing a real time computer vision project which notifies the driver when he feels fatigue or tired. 
•	Designing a convolutional neural network which classifies the driver’s face into two categories. 
•	Using full facial data from a number of sources, namely open eye face data from the UMass Amherst and closed eye face data from Nanjing University. 
•	Concepts and Tools used: TensorFlow and CNN
